The Mariners selected Logan Gilbert 14th overall in the 2018 MLB draft. He spent time in Arkansas, Modesto and West Virginia before getting called up to the majors in 2021 at age 24. He is 12-5 with a 3.66 ERA this season.

The Mariners selected George Kirby 20th overall in the 2019 draft. He played in Everett, Arkansas and Tacoma before getting called up to the big leagues last year at age 24. He is 10-8 with a 3.28 ERA.

The Mariners selected Bryce Miller in the fourth round of the 2021 MLB draft. He spent time in Modesto, Everett and Arkansas before getting called to the show last April at 24. He is 8-4 with a 3.93 ERA.

Bryan Woo was picked in the sixth round of the ’21 draft and has started 13 games this season. Emerson Hancock was the sixth overall pick in the 2020 draft, and though he has been shut down for the year, showed promise in his three starts this season. 

There is plenty of credit to be distributed when it comes to the pitching prowess of the Mariners. They have the best team ERA in baseball and a true ace in Luis Castillo, whose 3.01 ERA is fifth-lowest in MLB. But it’s those first five names mentioned in this column that epitomize the distinction between the Mariners and the rest of the league. They essentially built their starting rotation from scratch. 

Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci recently penned a piece on The Tampa Bay Rays’ inimitable ability to turn struggling pitchers into standouts. It’s part of the formula that has led the team to being in the top five in MLB in team ERA each of the past five seasons, and why the Rays are on track to reach the postseason for a fifth consecutive year.

But to draft, develop, promote — and then watch a bevy of arms dominate when they’ve been alive for only a quarter century? Show me another team that’s doing that. 

ESPN’s Jeff Passan said as much earlier three weeks ago on Seattle Sports with hosts Mike Salk and Brock Huard.

“The fact that they’re calling up Emerson Hancock and that over the last two [years] — I guess with Gilbert, you can go back a little further — but really over the last two years, they have brought up Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, Bryce Miller, Bryan Woo and now Emerson Hancock? They have essentially developed a full rotation internally,” Passan said. “That is a ridiculous thing to do over the course of two years.”

That interview was on Aug. 9 when the Mariners were 62-52, two games out of the AL wild-card race and 5 1/2 games behind Texas in the American League West. Now they are 76-57, in first place in the division and seem destined for a repeat postseason appearance.

No doubt the Mariners offense, which has posted the fifth-best OPS since the All-Star break, has played a pivotal role in that surge up the standings. And though Castillo might end up with the AL Cy Young Award, it’s the homegrown pitching that has anchored this squad.

Gilbert has had quality starts in five of his past six outings. Kirby leads MLB in strike percentage, walks per nine and strikeout to walk ratio. The Mariners have won in four of the past five games in which Miller started, as the rookie has taken his ERA from 4.35 to 3.93 over that stretch.

Fans have every right to criticize the M’s for their low payroll. According to spotrac.com, it was 18th in MLB this season, 21st last season and 25th in 2021. You usually have to spend to win, and though the Mariners have shelled out nine figures to Castillo, Robbie Ray and Julio Rodriguez, they haven’t made the championship splash their supporters want.

But if there is one way to offset parsimony, it’s with development. And given how young and promising this pitching core is, you can rest assured that some of the league’s top free agents are paying attention. Perhaps this offseason is when that much-desired cash splash comes.

In the meantime, the Mariners are playing as if they are the best team in the American League and have fans wondering if this is the year that they finally reach — and perhaps even win — the World Series.

They’ve spent the past month-plus separating themselves in the standings — mainly because they’ve spent the past few years breeding some of the finest pitchers in the league.

Julio Rodríguez has been at the forefront of the Seattle Mariners’ recent offensive improvement, but another M’s outfielder has also been red hot at the plate.

ESPN’s Olney sees some Derek Jeter in Seattle Mariners’ Julio Rodríguez

That would be Teoscar Hernández, who like Rodríguez had a monster month of August and played a big role in the Mariners winning a franchise-record 21 games that month.

In 26 games played in August, Hernández slashed .365/.396/.654 (1.050 OPS) with seven home runs, 16 extra-base hits and 22 RBIs.



The topic of Hernández’s big month of August came up during Thursday’s Jerry Dipoto Show on Seattle Sports.

“I’m curious, has Teo done anything different? Or is this just Teo, man, and when he gets hot, you let him ride?” Brock Huard asked the Mariners president of baseball operations.

Replied Dipoto, “I think the latter. And we’ve learned so much about Teo. Obviously, he has had kind of an up-and-down run and been more up than down for the last three months, really. He was awesome in June, and we got a glimpse of what he could be.”



After posting an OPS of .949 in June, it looked like Hernández was finally starting to click after two rough months to open the season. But he slid to a .534 OPS in July before catching fire in August.

Dipoto thinks there may be an easy answer as to why Hernández started to play better this month.

“The pressure associated with a team with expectations that’s underperforming as you head into the trade deadline and what that creates for the guys in the clubhouse, I’ve lived through that in my lifetime and it’s not easy,” said Dipoto, who was a longtime MLB reliever before his career in the front office. “And in this case, I do think that for a couple of our players – maybe Teo most notably – just the the ability to relax and breathe after the trade deadline and go about your business really did a lot … And right now, Teo has been as hot as anybody in the league not named Julio or Mookie (Betts). It’s good for him that he was able to do it and good for us because it came just at the right time.”


Dipoto said that Hernández hasn’t changed too much at the plate this year as he’s done many of the things he’s done throughout his career, such as hitting the ball hard despite having a lot of swing-and-miss to his game.

“He just didn’t really get those hot streaks (earlier in the season) like he has historically,” Dipoto said. “But as I said, two of the last three months he hasn’t just been hot, he’s been torrid hot. And now when you look up, we’re heading into September and his counting stats are right on par with the things that he’s always done, which frankly is why we traded for him was to deliver what he’s delivering.”

Additionally, Hernández has handled the up-and-down season very well, according to Dipoto.

“You’re not going to get a better guy. Great smile, awesome in the clubhouse, he works his tail off every day and he never changed,” he said. “He never blamed any type of struggle, any type of three-week downturns that he might have experienced through the years. He kept coming right back talking about the team game and focusing on the things that he could do, and then lo and behold, he kind of broke through. Hopefully he can keep it running this way through October.”

J.P. Crawford Is Choosier and Bruisier
by Davy Andrews 
August 31, 2023
Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports
Have I got news for you. The J.P. Crawford you know and love is now 50% more powerful! After running an ISO of .099 over the last two seasons, the Mariners shortstop is at .150 in 2023. And that’s not all. With that power has come increased production: Crawford’s 133 wRC+ is not just the best of his career, it’s second among all shortstops, trailing only Corey Seager’s 179 wRC+. Let’s act now and figure out what Crawford is doing differently this season.

With Crawford, plate discipline is always a good place to start. Crawford has always run low chase rates, but this season, he’s down to 21.2%. That’s fifth-lowest among all qualified players, and it’s led to a 15.6% walk rate, fourth-highest. However, while Crawford is chasing less and walking more, he’s also striking out more. While his 19% strikeout rate is still better than the average player, it’s a jump of more than five percentage points from last season.

Crawford is running a career-best 37.3% hard-hit rate. That’s still well below average, but it’s a huge jump for someone who was in the fifth percentile in 2022. It may seem like Crawford has made the classic power-for-contact tradeoff, but that’s only true to an extent. Players who make that tradeoff usually whiff more because they’re being more aggressive at the plate. Crawford is hitting the ball harder and striking out more, but he’s actually been more passive than ever. His swing rate has dropped by almost exactly the same amount on pitches inside the zone and outside the zone.

I’m going to show you three heat maps. The one in the middle is Crawford’s slugging percentage on balls in play over the course of his career. It shows where he does damage. On the left is Crawford’s swing rate in 2022, and on the right is his swing rate in 2023:


This is as big a change as you’re going to see. Last year, Crawford would swing at pretty much anything over the heart of the plate. This year, he’s focused on a much smaller area, pitches in the absolute center of the zone, much closer to where he really does damage. Here’s what that looks like in terms of Baseball Savant’s swing/take decisions:

Swing/Take Run Value
Year	Total Pitches	Heart	Shadow	Chase	Waste	All
2022	2,583	-19	-20	21	12	-5
2023	2,089	-4	-10	22	8	16
SOURCE: Baseball Savant
Crawford is chasing less, so the improvements in the shadow and chase zones shouldn’t surprise us much. The heart of the plate is where things get interesting. Let’s break those numbers into their constituent parts:

Swing/Take Run Value – Heart Only
Year	Take	Swing
2022	-11	-8
2023	-11	+8
SOURCE: Baseball Savant
In both 2022 and thus far in 2023, when Crawford took pitches over the heart of the plate, he was worth -11 runs. That’s makes sense, as all of those pitches end up as called strikes. When he has swung at pitches over the heart of the plate, he’s been 16 runs better than he was last year! His wOBA on those swings has gone from .312 to .400. Crawford is taking more strikes, which hurts a little, but he’s more than making up for it when he does swing.

Still, none of this explains why he’s making less contact. Here’s the thing I think is really fascinating. Take a look at Crawford’s whiff percentage broken down by pitch type:

J.P. Crawford’s Whiff Rate
Year	Fastball	Breaking	Offspeed
2022	11.1	19.4	19.7
2023	10.1	28.5	32.7
SOURCE: Baseball Savant
Note: Fastball includes cutters in this table and the ones that follow.
Crawford is gearing up to hit the fastball in a way he hasn’t been in previous seasons. He’s missing them a bit less often, and his wOBA against them has jumped from .315 to .394. Gearing up to hit the fastball can have a side effect: getting fooled more often on softer stuff. Crawford is whiffing a lot more against breaking balls and offspeed stuff. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s performing worse on softer stuff. Take a look at his actual results, once again using Baseball Savant’s run values:

J.P. Crawford’s Run Values
Year	Fastball	Breaking	Offspeed
2022	-0.7	1.1	-0.7
2023	1.1	-0.3	1.4
SOURCE: Baseball Savant
Crawford is indeed doing worse against breaking stuff, but he has completely turned himself around against both fastballs and offspeed stuff. How is he doing so well against changeups and splitters when he’s whiffing on them over 50% more often than he did last year? Furthermore, since he’s now much worse against breaking balls, why haven’t pitchers started throwing them way more often?

J.P. Crawford’s Average Exit Velocity
Year	Fastball	Breaking	Offspeed
2022	85.2	83.8	83.9
2023	88.6	85.8	89.9
SOURCE: Baseball Savant
The answer to the first question is that Crawford is offsetting all those extra whiffs by hitting the ball much harder, especially against offspeed stuff. His soft contact rate has dropped to a career low, and his 95th-percentile exit velocity increased from 105 mph to 106.2. As for the second question, breaking stuff often requires a hitter to chase in order to be effective, and Crawford doesn’t do that. If your plan is to get Crawford out by deluging him with soft stuff, you’re likely to end up behind in the count.

As I pulled all these numbers together, I was reminded of something Robert Orr wrote back in June for Baseball Prospectus. Orr detailed how Ronald Acuña Jr., previously a dead-pull hitter, had begun letting fastballs travel a little deeper and sending them the other way, which led to a convenient knock-on effect:

“What happens when Acuña thinks a fastball is coming and he’s wrong. If he starts on time for 96 and gets 96, then he laces a base hit into the gap. That’s good. If he starts on time for 96 and gets 87, though? That’s when he can catch the ball out in front of the plate, and that’s where homers are. That’s better.”

Crawford is coming from the opposite end of the spectrum. He ran a 34.2% pull rate last year, compared to Acuña’s 44.5%. But this year, they’ve ended up in the same place: Crawford at 41% and Acuña at 40.5%. Here’s what the change looks like when you break it down by pitch type:

J.P. Crawford’s Pull Rate
Year	Fastball	Breaking	Offspeed
2022	28.5	41.7	44.6
2023	31.8	53.2	72.7
SOURCE: Baseball Savant
Crawford is pulling the ball way more often, especially against non-fastballs. Those pulled balls haven’t turned into homers, because even this version of him is still way less powerful than Acuña, but he’s gone from the bottom end of the spectrum up toward the middle. Further, Crawford’s 39.2% groundball rate is the lowest it’s been since he became a regular starter. Meeting those balls out in front is helping him pull them in the air, making the most of his increased power.

Under normal circumstances, I might have ended this article here. We’re pushing 2,000 words, and I’ve typed the name Crawford so many times that I’ve lost the ability to comprehend its meaning. It’s just a string of letters to me, and that A-W-F-O section in the middle is really starting to freak me out. Who does that? The only word I can think of that contains an A-W-F-O stretch is ‘clawfoot,’ and I think we can all agree that that’s one of the creepiest words in the English language. However, there are two things I’d still like to address. The first is how Crawford came about this extra power. You might remember that he’s tried to improve his power output before. Before the 2021 season, he packed on 20 pounds of muscle in hopes of increasing his slugging. Unfortunately the Get Yoked, Go Smash method only raised his ISO by 20 points, while his hard-hit rate actually got worse.

This year, he’s increased his average exit velocity by 3.9 mph, the third-highest jump among qualified players. Some of this can be explained by choosing better pitches to hit and pulling the ball more often. Some of it can likely be explained by improved health, since Crawford played through back, pec, leg, and knee injuries last season. Lastly, Crawford trained at Driveline this offseason, after taking six weeks to recover from all of the injuries to all of his body parts.


While I was researching this article, I stumbled onto an episode of the Sea Level podcast that featured Maxx Garrett, the hitting trainer who worked with Crawford this winter. I’m normally reluctant to draw a straight line from a swing change to improved results. There are so many factors involved in hitting. Seemingly everybody comes into spring training in the best shape of their life and with a new swing. Some of those players are bound to improve, and while the hard work they put in during the offseason likely helped, giving all the credit to their new bat waggle is often a facile conclusion. However, Garrett gave host Ben Ranieri some pretty interesting details that dovetailed nicely with what I found in the numbers.

First, Garrett confirmed that the focus was on improving Crawford’s bat speed, as his plate discipline is already elite. Referring to his notes, he said that Crawford’s bat speed was measured at 65.6 mph at the beginning of training and 71.1 at the end. “We saw some movement things, especially with his setup, his load, kind of that load, stride, into landing, where he was in some unique positions that not many of our high-level hitters get into,” said Garrett. “And it was making it harder for him to produce as much force as he was capable of.”

Let’s go to the tape. On the left is a swing from 2022, and on the right is a swing from 2023:


I’ve pulled some stills below to illustrate the differences. Crawford starts off with his stance much more closed. He’s changed his bat angle, lowered his hands, and tucked both his hands and elbows closer to his body. Once he gets into his leg kick, he’s crouching slightly deeper, his front shoulder is angled downward, and his shoulders are rotated further away from the pitcher. If not for his hair, his entire name would be visible on the back of his jersey. The follow-through makes it easy to see how much harder Crawford is swinging, and how much higher he’s finishing. Keep in mind that Crawford crushes both of these pitches. They’re both middle-middle four-seamers that result in hard-hit balls to right-center. Crawford actually hits the ball on the left much harder, but look at how he finishes. He’s much more upright, much less athletic. The swing on the right is clearly more explosive:


Garrett also said that they focused on Crawford’s attack angle, helping him to hit the ball in the air more. This is the part that made me sit up and listen: Garrett described a drill that involved feeding Crawford fastballs from an extremely high attack angle and from off to the side, beyond the right base side of the rubber. “So basically, an extreme lefty release,” he said. “And that was forcing him to get his barrel out front, have it work up. His intent was to move fast, hit the ball higher, to the pull side. Really get his barrel out front, working up more into the ball.” To me, that sounds like a pretty good explanation for the way Crawford has been able to attack fastballs, punish offspeed stuff, and pull the ball in the air this season.


The last thing I need to mention is less fun. Crawford’s defense has been quite bad this year. A Gold Glover in 2020, Crawford’s 14 errors are tied for fifth-most in the league, and most defensive metrics rank him as one of the game’s worst fielders. That’s a real bummer, because if Crawford rated as even a league-average defender at short, he would be a top 20 player in all of baseball this season. It’s always good to take defensive metrics with a grain of salt, and any player experiencing such a big drop-off is a candidate to regress back to the mean the following season. Crawford has already turned himself into an All-Star caliber player this season. If he can hold on to some of his gains at the plate and get his defense back toward the middle of the pack, the future is even brighter.
